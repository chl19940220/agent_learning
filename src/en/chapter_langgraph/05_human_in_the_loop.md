# Human-in-the-Loop: Human-AI Collaboration

In production environments, letting an Agent run completely autonomously is risky — operations like deleting files, sending emails, and processing payments are irreversible once they go wrong. The **Human-in-the-Loop** mechanism allows the Agent to pause before executing dangerous operations and wait for human confirmation before continuing.

LangGraph implements this capability through the **Checkpointer** mechanism. The Checkpointer saves a state snapshot at every step of graph execution, allowing the graph to pause and resume at any node.

## Using Checkpointer for Pause and Resume

### Core Idea

1. **Classify tools by danger level**: categorize tools as "safe" or "dangerous"
2. **Conditional routing**: when a dangerous tool call is detected, stop graph execution
3. **State saving**: save the graph's current state via `MemorySaver`
4. **Human approval**: obtain user confirmation externally
5. **Resume execution**: after approval, use `app.invoke(None, config)` to continue from where it paused

# MemorySaver allows resuming execution
memory = MemorySaver()

# Note on the interrupt mechanism:
# Two complementary safety strategies are used here:
# 1. check_needs_approval (conditional routing): returns END for dangerous tools, stopping graph execution
# 2. interrupt_before (compile parameter): acts as an extra safety net, pausing before all tool nodes
#
# Actual behavior:
# - Safe tools (e.g., safe_search): routed to "tools" node by check_needs_approval,
#   but interrupt_before will pause before execution (remove this line to let safe tools auto-execute)
# - Dangerous tools (e.g., send_email): directly routed to END by check_needs_approval
#
# If you only want to interrupt for dangerous tools, remove interrupt_before
# and rely entirely on check_needs_approval's routing logic.

## Three Approval Patterns

In real applications, human-AI collaboration isn't limited to just "approve/reject." Depending on the business scenario, three approval strategies can be designed:

**Pattern 1: Simple Approve/Reject (Gate Pattern)**

This is the example above — the Agent proposes an operation, and the human decides whether to execute it.

```python
# Use case: irreversible operations (delete, send, pay)
# Flow: Agent → pause → human decision → execute or cancel
```

**Pattern 2: Edit Then Execute (Edit Pattern)**

Humans can not only approve/reject, but also **modify** the Agent's decision content before executing.

```python
def edit_and_resume(app, config, state):
    """Allow humans to edit the Agent's tool call parameters"""
    last_msg = state["messages"][-1]
    
    if hasattr(last_msg, "tool_calls") and last_msg.tool_calls:
        tc = last_msg.tool_calls[0]
        print(f"Agent wants to execute: {tc['name']}({tc['args']})")
        
        # Allow human to modify parameters
        edited_args = input("Modify parameters (JSON format, press Enter to keep original): ").strip()
        
        if edited_args:
            import json
            tc['args'] = json.loads(edited_args)
            # Update the message in state
            app.update_state(config, {"messages": [last_msg]})
        
        # Continue execution (with original or modified parameters)
        return app.invoke(None, config=config)
```

**Pattern 3: Tiered Approval (Tiered Pattern)**

Different risk levels of operations use different approval strategies:

```python
# Risk level definitions
TOOL_RISK_LEVELS = {
    "search": "low",          # Low risk: auto-execute
    "read_file": "low",
    "send_email": "medium",   # Medium risk: requires confirmation
    "create_order": "medium",
    "delete_data": "high",    # High risk: requires double confirmation
    "transfer_money": "high",
}

def tiered_approval(tool_name: str) -> str:
    """Determine approval strategy based on risk level"""
    risk = TOOL_RISK_LEVELS.get(tool_name, "medium")
    
    if risk == "low":
        return "auto_approve"    # Auto-execute
    elif risk == "medium":
        return "single_approve"  # Single confirmation
    else:
        return "double_approve"  # Double confirmation + audit log
```

## Human-in-the-Loop in Production

In production environments, "human confirmation" is typically not a command-line `input()` call, but implemented through an asynchronous notification system:

```python
# Typical production architecture
"""
1. Agent encounters an operation requiring approval → pause execution
2. Backend saves Checkpoint to persistent storage (PostgreSQL/Redis)
3. Send approval notification (Slack/email/Teams/DingTalk)
4. Human makes a decision in the approval interface
5. Frontend/Webhook calls the resume API
6. Agent resumes from Checkpoint and continues execution
"""

# Example using PostgreSQL for persistent Checkpoints
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver

# Connect to database
DB_URI = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/agent_db"
checkpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(DB_URI)

# Compile graph with persistent checkpointer
app = graph.compile(
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
    interrupt_before=["dangerous_tools"]
)

# FastAPI endpoint: resume execution
# @app.post("/approve/{thread_id}")
# async def approve_action(thread_id: str, approved: bool):
#     config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}
#     if approved:
#         result = agent_app.invoke(None, config=config)
#         return {"status": "completed", "result": result}
#     else:
#         return {"status": "rejected"}
```

> 💡 **Key note**: In production, `MemorySaver` is only suitable for development and testing. For formal deployment, use `PostgresSaver` or `RedisSaver` to ensure Agent state can be recovered after service restarts.

## Summary

Key points for implementing Human-in-the-Loop:
- **MemorySaver**: saves graph execution state, supports resumption
- **interrupt_before/after**: interrupt before or after specific nodes
- **thread_id**: identifies a session, used for state recovery
- **Safety policy**: dangerous operations (delete, send email, payment) must require confirmation
